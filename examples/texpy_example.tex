This is an example of using \texttt{texpy}.

\pyno{
from numpy import *
}

Here are two arrays that should print nicely:
\py{
t = arange(0,1,0.01)
y = sin(2*pi*t)
}

and here is some trivial math:
\py{
a = 3
b = 4
c = a+b
}

Equation labels are supported:
\py{
label=eq:example
d = c**2
}
Equation~\ref{eq:example} is pretty important.
